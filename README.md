### Computer Engineering-Thesis project: A web application for emotional video-compositing

The goal of this thesis work was the realization of a web-application that allows to manage and compose together a set videoclips trough a specifical video-editor, suggesting and helping the user during the choice of files relyng of their emotional characterization.
The main user interfaces are two: 
- Video-editor, which allows to merge video sequences taken from the databes and filtering them trough specific paramenters. 
- Annotator, which allow to a group of different users to mark every video clip with a praticular emtional value. This value can be determined with two fundamental parameters: arousal and valence, whose combination can determinies the mood aroused by the video to the spectator.

Every user has its own account to store its annotations.
The two fundamental technologies used to realize this project are Docker and the web framework Django.
